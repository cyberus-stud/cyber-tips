# Cyberus Stud - Cyber Security Prerequisites Road Map

---
## Disclaimer

There is no such thing as a road map for Cyber Security, but we at Cyberus Stud try to ease your entry to the offensive security field. In this repo we will discuss
how you can get started to learn Cyber Security, specifically the offensive side.

## What is a cyber security?

 > Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security.
 >
 > There is tow types of cyber security:
 >
 > - *Offensive Security*: It's the practice of attacking computer systems to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers.
 > - *Defensive Security*: It's the practice of protecting computer systems from attacks by hackers.

## What do you need to start?

> To get your feet wet, you would need to start with the following:
> - Basic Computer Science Concepts
> - Basic Programming Concepts
> - Linux Basics
> - Computer Networking Basics

## Getting Started

### Basic Computer Science Concepts

> Basically, the only course you need here is the [CS50 from harvard](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x), it will be more than enough to help you get started in computer science and introduce you to various important topics including programming.

---
### Basic Programming Concepts

> After taking the CS50 course, you should have a good understanding of the concept of programming, but you will need to go a bit deeper than the CS50's programming content and create more complex projects with your prefered programming language, this will introduce you to OOP, Functional Programming, debuging and being able to identify bugs in code, automating boring processes, etc ...

> You can learn programming anywhere on the internet, if you prefer watching videos [Freecodecamp Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) is a good source, if you prefer reading [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a great source.

> You will also need to know basics of web development and start creating small web projects.

### Linux Basics

#### What is Linux?
 > Linux is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel.

#### Why Linux?
 > Linux is free and open-source operating system, it is the most used operating system for cyber security related activities.

#### Steps to help you get started with linux
 > 1- Familiarize yourself with the Linux operating system: Start by downloading and installing a Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu or Fedora, on a virtual machine or as a dual-boot setup on your computer.

 > 2- Learn the basics of the terminal: The terminal is a powerful tool in Linux, and it's essential to know how to use it to perform basic operations such as navigating the file system and executing commands.

 > 3- Study Linux commands: Become familiar with commonly used Linux commands, such as ls, cd, and cp, as well as more advanced commands, such as sed and awk.

 > 4- Learn about file permissions: Understanding file permissions is essential for managing the security of your system. Learn how to set and modify file permissions and ownership.

 > 5- Get hands-on experience: The best way to learn is through hands-on experience. Try to perform various tasks, such as creating and editing files, installing software, and managing users and groups, to get a feel for how the system works.

 > 6- Study bash scripting: Bash is the default shell in most Linux distributions, and it's a powerful tool for automating tasks. Study bash scripting to learn how to write scripts that automate repetitive tasks.

 > 7- Learn about package management: Package management is a central part of the Linux system, and it's essential to know how to use it to install, upgrade, and remove software.

### Computer Networking Basics

#### What is Computer Networking?
> Computer networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices together to allow them to communicate and share resources. This can be accomplished through the use of various hardware and software technologies, such as wired and wireless network adapters, routers, switches, and protocols.

### Why Computer Networking?
> Computer networking is an important aspect of cyber security because it provides the infrastructure that enables communication and data exchange between computers and other devices. Understanding computer networking is essential for protecting networks and systems from various types of cyber security threats, such as hacking, malware, and data breaches.

#### Steps to help you get started with computer networking

 > 1- Familiarize yourself with networking concepts and terminologies: Start by learning the basic concepts of computer networking, such as IP addressing, subnetting, and routing. Become familiar with networking terminologies and acronyms, such as LAN, WAN, and TCP/IP.

 > 2- Study networking protocols and standards: Learn about the most commonly used networking protocols, such as TCP, UDP, and IP, as well as industry standards such as IEEE 802.11 for wireless networks.

> 3- Learn about network topologies and design: Study different network topologies, such as star, bus, and ring, and learn about network design principles, such as scalability and reliability.

> 4- Study network devices: Familiarize yourself with the various types of network devices, such as routers, switches, and firewalls, and learn about their functions and how they work.

> 5- Practice configuring network devices: Get hands-on experience configuring network devices, such as routers and switches, using command line interfaces and graphical user interfaces.

> 6- Learn about network security: Study network security concepts, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and encryption, and learn how they are used to protect networks.
